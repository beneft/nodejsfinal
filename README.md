You need to create one in project directory by yourself.
This include:
USER = <your gmail>
PASS = <your gmail application password>
DB_URI = <your mongodb cluster link>
DB_LOCAL_URL = <your mondodb local instance address>

Everything should work as intended on localhost.
Admin actions are available after manually changing user's role in db to 'admin'.
